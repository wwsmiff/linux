# Linux Stuff
This repository contains my dotfiles and an archive of my linux journey.

### Layout
- Each directory is named with a month and year corresponding to that time in my linux journey along with the software I used. The directory contains a few details about the setup and a dotfiles directory with a commit corresponding to that specific setup.
